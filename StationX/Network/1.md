Model reporesentations to help understand complex ideias

OSI - 7 Layer Modal
Network model
Ethernet Frames - send throught the cable or radio frequency

Layers -

1. Physical - 

Gettint the one and zeros to one sytems to another

2. Data Link - 
Inspect if the data is for them, checking the destination Mac Address

3. Network

Look the ip adresses destination, like the Data LInk layer but look the IP.

4. Transport

Assemble and disamble the data, chop into 1500 bytes data maximum each one, 

5. Session

Part of the host to connect to the other host, guard the port information,

6. Presentation

Gets in the format of the application can read

7. Application Layer

Smart built in the application.


---------------------------------

Meet the Frame

NetworkInterfaceCard - Nic
Hub - Connected more computers to share resources
Local Area NetWork
Basicaly Binary sending Data
Send by Frames vs. Packet big chunk of one and zeros, or stream

-----

Mac Address

Physical Adrdress = mac adress
12 digits, sux duples - OEM numbers, and unique ID, 48 boit
Used in the second layer
Fixed and Static

------------

BroadCast Vs. Unicast

Unicast - on the data has the exact mac address
Broadcast - Have all F on the mac adress, anyone on the local area network can acesse

-------

IP Addressing 

Logical Addressing
Used in big network
On the send data ahve the receive and send ip, in the ip pack.
Used on layer 3

----------------

Packets and Ports

80 HTTP
20 21 - FTTP
Ports are used when receive the data, this data will be used on the correct application
TCP - Transmition Control Protocol- converse between two computers
UDP - is not connected oriented
