Example grafo de usuarios
friendship = {user["id"]: [] for user in users}

# And loop over the friendship pairs to populate it:
for i, j in friendship_pairs:
    friendships[i].append(j)  # Add j as a friend of user i
    friendships[j].append(i)  # Add i as a friend of user j

    def number_of_friends(user):
    """How many friends does _user_ have?"""
    user_id = user["id"]
    friend_ids = friendships[user_id]
    return len(friend_ids)

total_connections = sum(number_of_friends(user)
                        for user in users)        # 24
