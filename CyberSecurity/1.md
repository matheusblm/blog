1.  Why do we need to do penetration Testing?

The MITRE ATT&CK framework (https://attack.mitre.org) 
The OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) 
Special Publication (SP) 800-115 is a document created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), developed by Pete Herzog, 
The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) (http://www.pentest-standard.org) 
The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is another penetration testing methodology.

1. Security Principles

1.1 CIA - Confidentiality Integrity and Availability
No private information has been acces for a non autorized user.
Integratity the information is right not has been change
Availability need to bee there on the time 

1.2 Authentication = verify if the user have the right privelegios to acces the data

SFA = single factor authentication
MFA = multiple factor authentication

Prove who whe are

Non repydiation protection againts an individual falsely denying having a performed a particular action.

Privacy the right of an individual control the distribution of information about themselves.

2. Risk Management

Value the probability and impact
Asset is something in need of protection
Vulnerability gap or weakness in those protection efforts
Threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts

3.  Security Controls
 Physical, techinical and administrative mecahnism that acts as safeguards or countermeasures to protect the system
