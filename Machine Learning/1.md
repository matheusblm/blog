Pratical advice for applying learning


-- Supervised Learning

Give examples with correct asnwers

Example
Input x - spam ? - Spam filtering
audio - text transcripts - speech recongtion

Regression: House price prediciton based com the house size
Predict a number infinitely many possibile

Classification - Breast cancer detection - Prediciations smals numbers 1 or 0, not the inifitely many posibles
Predict categories, predict a image its a dog ou cat
Small numbers of predications
Two or more inputs

-- Unsupervised learning
find something interesintg in unlabeled data
what type of data os structures
Clustering data - ex find some articles related
Group data

Anomaly detection - find unusual data points.
Dimensionality reduction - compress data using fewers numbers.

--- Jupyter Notebooks


--- LInear Regression With One variable
The most used model today

Regression model predicts numbers
Linear will be a line in the graph and find the exact price of house proce x size
Terminology - 
Data used to train the model, training set
NOtation x = input variable
output variable
target variable

m = number of training examples
(x,y) = single trainig examples
ith trainig example
(x(i), y(i))

Training set - features, targets
Learning algorithm
Function = Hypothesis y-hat
feature model prediction (estimated y)

How to represent f? (This example a simple LINE)

fw,b(x) = wx + b
f(x)
