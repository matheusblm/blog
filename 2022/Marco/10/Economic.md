The economic is a machine.

1. Productivity growth
2. Short Term Debt Cycle
3. Long term debt cycle

### Transactions

buyer -> seller

All cycles are driven by transactions

market = buyer and seller doing transaction

Exchange money and credit

Central bank can interest rates and printing more money, he is a important player in flow of credit.

### Credit

is the most important part in the economic, because is very volatile part.

Lender -> borrower

Borrower promise to repay the money
When the interrest rates are high have less borrowing.

**Speding drives the economy**

one person spending someone earn, turn this in a cycle

### Cycles

we have cycles becausa someano borrow money from the lender, spend that money, make more money, pay the lender. An the peoople who he's pay do the same thing.

The motive to we have cycles, it's because the credit exist. So for us buy something, we can borrow the money, no only raise our receive.

The credit start to be bad, when the consumer buy things he can pay in the future.

### Money and Credit

When u pay with money, the transaction start and end in the same time, but when u pay with credit, you are makeing a promise to pay in the future. The transaction only finish when u pay the credit, so the debt stop existing

### Short Term debt cycle

1. expasion - expend continue to increase, filed by credit.

When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the productions of goods. Price rise, inflation start.

The central bank, doenst link the high inflaition, because the interest rate its raise to, and the counter-effect the people borrow less money.

When people spend less, price go down, this is call deflation.

Economic activity decrease, and we have a recession.

If the recession its no too big, the bank can low the interest rates, and the cycle start again.

when the credit its available = have a economic expansion

when the credit its unavailable = recession

the short term debt cycle typically last 5-8 years, when happend over and over.

### The long term debt cycle

When a person start to ear less than need to pay the debit, this generates a cycle.
Debt repayment start to goin up.

The markt start to go down, the peopple cant borrow more, and need to sell they assests to try to pay the debit.

The first thing to do in this scenario.
1. Cut the spending - Auterity
2. Reduce debts
3. 3
4.

Deflation the people realize the promise that they would be pay some day, not exist anymore.

all of this impact several the central government, beacuse lower incomes and less emplyment mean the government collects les tax.

like the interests rate its 0%, goverment need to print more money.
